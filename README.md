# The Project

Plaza Ath√©n√©e is a fictional restaurant based in USA. They have requested your help to build a website that will help them reach to younger public. They want it to be fast, dynamic and responsive.

## Well...

In fact this is for Microverse based in this [requirements](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

> Restaurant Page project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of Microverse.

The Restaurant Page is a JavaScript project, built using DOM manipulation and webpack. The restaurant shows a description of the services, a menu with some dishes (with a _delicate_ animation), and a welcoming contact page. Most of the web is created using JavaScript String Templates, changing the view dynamically with event listeners.

I created the design, configured the project and coded the webpage, so I was the designer, UI/UI engineer, Web Programmer, etc.

## Prerequisites

- `git`
- `npm` 6.13 +
- `node` 11.15 +
- A Text Editor like VSCode
- A browser like Firefox or Chrome

## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/Israel-Laguan/SUSHI-FUSION.git
cd sushi-fusion
npm i && npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the app.

### Where are the generated files?

In `development` mode `webpack` does not write generated files to disk, in order to change it
switch `devServer.writeToDisk` to `true` in [webpack.dev.js](./webpack.dev.js). When you use `production ` mode, the generated files are on `dist/` folder.

### Run development build

To run the development build (the one that don't generate files) just run in the terminal `npm start`

## Production

- `npm run build` to prepare `html`, `css`, `js` files in `dist/` directory. The gerated files are ready to put in production, also you can open the `index.html` in your local browser so you can see the result.

## Run tests

Run `ESlint` with `npm run lint` to verify linter rules are applied correctly. If you want to auto correct you can run `npm run lint-fix`. Optionally you can run the linter and tests: `npm run linter && npm test`

## Future/planned features

- [ ] Contact Form with a custom message
- [ ] Improve Home View
- [ ] Add Dishes and their description
- [ ] When you click a dish, you have a button to reservate that dish in the form
